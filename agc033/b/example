.s.

## consideration
- S can go max-R, max-L, max-U, max-D
  - we can calculate each value in Step-i.
  - sr[i], sl[i], su[i], sd[i]
- We cancaluculate same values of T.
  - tr[i], tl[i], tu[i], td[i]

- limit is calculated from W, H and start.

- If (sr[i] - tl[i]) > limit-r or other case, Takahashi win. In other case, Aoki win.
