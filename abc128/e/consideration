## consideration
- time[i]: (Si-0.5-Xi)..(Ti-0.5-Xi) = l[i]..r[i]
  - If Q is in time[i], then the person is stopped by Xi.
- We want to know "the lowest Xi that can stop the person.
  - the lowest X[i] where Q >= l[i] and Q <= r[i] for all i.

## idea
- segment tree?

## the other idea
- first, make the list of Q.
- second, check the position of l[i] and r[i] in the list of Q.
  - If
