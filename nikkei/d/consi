## cons

- (s,t) where L<=s<t<=R
  - O(N^2)

## what thought
- we must operation in logN or rootN in each step
  - M is 10^5, so N is not permitted.
- we can store the "minimum path" in each step.

## aproach 1
- store "minimum distance to goal" in each step.
  -

## aproach 2
- make cycle
  - in ordinary case,

## aproach 3
- sort by "distance"
  - we should use "minimum distance" if it can be done.
- then, compare the "whole dist" or "summed dist"

## aproachkk:w


## e.g. 1

## bad idea
// We make new graph. In the graph, each step of M is node, and overrwappness is the the edge.
